	git merge —squash allow U to merge with whatever branch you want (as master) and pick all commits from You want to merge in master and sqaush those changes into one commit on top of master : steps :

		git checkout master 
(be on the branch you want merge to )

		git merge --squash 
localBranch (branch you want merge from, apply commits from here)

		git commit -m ‘changes from localBranch squash’

It is a quick way of cherry-picking instead U just grab every commit from this branch and then merge

The difference between git merge <branch> and git merge --squash <branch> is the first one commits and merges automatically and merge --squash needs adding files and committing manually
