	only pick commits you are intrested in hence cherry-picking 

	lets say you want to add commit  to master branch from any branch (git will find commit based on the number not branch name) 

	so you any/develop branch has those commits:

	5ca89c4 (HEAD -> develop) new-file-added
	cbcccdd ramda tutorial started
	cc34f53 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) package.json clean up

	but U want to merge with only 'ramda tutorial started' commit so we need to cherry pick this commit hashNumber  as follows:

		1) swith to master: git co master
		2) make sure U master is up-to-date: git fecth, git pull origin master
		3) pick the commit you want to add to master: git cherry-picking cbcccdd (hashNumber)
		
	now you should have this commit on top of your

	1602503 (HEAD -> master) conflict resolved cherry-pick (in case you had conflict resolve them and commit changes)
	731908f ramda added
	cc34f53 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) package.json clean up
