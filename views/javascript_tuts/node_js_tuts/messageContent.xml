            <info>
      By defaualt any npm i/install package will install latest package with 'carret' minor version as loadash:'^1.3.4' alowing minor
      update to the version up below 2 as explained below:

      There are 3 type of npm semenatic vesrioning:

      major - upgrade from 1.0.0 to 2.00 (usually breaking changes)
      minor - upgrade from 1.0.0 to max 1.9.0 (no breaking changes, minor changes)
      patch - upgrade from 1.0.0 to max 1.0.9 (no breaking changes, bug fix)

      From mpm 5.x.x by npm install package-lock.json will be created that tracks all exact versions of the packages.


            </info>
            <example>
              /-- outcome in package.json----/

  npm i lodash -S/ --save produces loadash:'^1.3.4' allowed updated below 2.

  npm i lodash@1.4.5 -S/ --save produces loadash:'1.4.5' no updates version.

  npm i lodash -SE/ --save produces loadash:'1.7.4'(any latest same as npm i lodash@latest -SE/) not allowed updates.


  explained:
  //there is no information how to istall patch version of a package ~1.3.4 , so for now just need to be updated manually
  in package.json if needed.



            </example>
        </paragraph>
        <subtitle>npm update, npm </subtitle>
        <paragraph>
            <info>this will update all your package in a scope of the folder even if package-lock.json is present. 
/--/

npm update => updates project local packages

npm update packagename = updates one package 

npm update -g => updates globall installed packages

npm update packagename -g = updates one package installed globally 

there is some usufull npm commands that will tell you if your packages needs update to prevent errors
/--/

            </info>
            <example>
/----/

//list packages needed update locally / -g globally 
 -- npm outdated 



/-------- npm list ----------/

//view curent installed version locally / -g globally 
npm list --depth 0 

---IMPORATANT ---

this command also flags that which packages needs attentsion, update flaged as: UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY
U need to habe node_modules alredy present so after npm install. npm outdated it wont flag outdated packges
if they are not installed , so always run FIRST ::  npm list --depth 0 



//----------- npm update ----------/

this command will FIX all unmet depedencies regardless the package-lock.json versioning 
IMPORTANT any package needs updating it has to have minor or patch version enables in package.json
from node-sass:'1.3.4' it has to have node-sass:'^1.3.4' or node-sass:'`1.3.4'. It will not install 
update otherwise!

------------------------------------

//update all package / -g globally
-- npm update

//update single package / -g globally
-- npm update package

------ minor usage npm commands -------

//list all historical version about the package / -g globally
-- npm view enzyme versions

//clean unused dependencies (it wont fix unmet dependecies errors just will do repository clean up)
-- npm prune /or npm prun package

//package home page 
-- npm home package

//package repo page 
-- npm repo package

//package docs page 
-- npm docs package

//list curent bugs page 
 -- npm bugs package

    <subject>node version manager (nvm) installation</subject>
    <content>
        <subtitle>why do we need nvm ?</subtitle>
        <paragraph>
            <info>sometimes when U managing multiple project from diffent time, packages gets updated, outeded and there is time U will update your 
              node.js itself. Then some packages it wont work anymore. One way is to start updating them (very tidious) but not neccessary if you dont run your app
              in production. The other solution is to install node that U need for the project and switch between node version.</info>
            <example>
  /----/

              
  1/- install nvm from official web , which is currnelty github : https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash

//this script will do:
  -- install nvm package, 
  -- update .bashrc or .bash_profile with nvm paths(depending which do U have on your system)
  -- create /.nvm directory in root

  2. restart your bash for changes to take effect:

  -- source ./bash_profile

  3. check if nvm works 
  -- nvm --version


  4. all global packages wont work anymore, but nvm give you the option to use and to delte them , we are just going to use them
  if you want uninstall npm global packages npm uninstall -g a_module, (not recomended since they will be used by some software)

  //reuse global npm modules 
  -- nvm use system

  //prints for me ::: Now using system version of node: v12.14.1 (npm v6.13.4)

  the version of system node.js is 12.14.1 but it will change if you install diffrent by nvm install 10.20.1 for example, the process is
  explained in the tab : nvm manage and install node versions in this document.


/----/
            </example>
        </paragraph>
        <subtitle>nvm manage and install node versions</subtitle>
        <paragraph>
            <info>after instalation your ./nvm repository doesnt have any node versions , thefore U need to install them, below are some usefull comamnds to get it done</info>
            <example>
/----/

---------- after nvm istalation commands ----------

//list currently installed node.js versions for nvm
-- nvm ls 

//list all remote node version for instalation 
-- nvm ls-remote

---------- after nvm istalation there is no node versions installed so start instaling them one by one according the needs ----------
for example:

//install node version 10 ((Latest LTS: Dubnium))
nvm install 10.20.1

IMPORTANT: this version now is default version on your machine (since is the only one for now)


//install node 12.14.1 
nvm install 12.14.1

IMPORTANT: this version now is set for the session but it is not default one !


------------------- nvn alias default node-version ---------

this command will set your default node version for new shell 

//to make 12.14.1 
nvm alias default 12.14.1

//to make 10.14.1 
nvm alias default 10.14.1 etc 

------------------------------ nvm use version -----------------------

after setting yours aliases and installing version you can use it 

//use and set default (for curent and (new sessions !!)
nvm use default 

IMPORARTANT: use default will keep this version for new sessions as well 

//use alias node10 (only for the time of shell session)
nvm use node10 

//use alias node8 (only for the time of shell session)
nvm use node8 

//use installed version (no alias) 10.20.1 (only for the time of shell session)
nvm use 10.20.1

        <paragraph>
            <info>module.exports = {} usually exports an object,function , once exports.sth can export anything . 
              Rules:  
                1. U can not user module.exports = {} and exports in the same file
                2. module.exports = {} can be only one in the file. As defualt export in ES6 modules.
                3. exports can be used multiple times in the file. As { named exports } in ES6 modules.
            </info>
            <example>
/ --- export same object both ways ----/

  export.text1 = 'text1';
  export.text2 = 'text2';
  export.text3 = 'text3';

/ --- request exports ---/

  var texts = require(./texts)

  console.log(texts.text2)
  console.log(texts.text3)

/ --- same with module.exports -----/

module.exports = {

}

/ --- request exports same way---/

  var texts = require(./texts)

    <subject>Express Middleware</subject>
     <content>
          <subtitle>what is express Middleware ?</subtitle>
       <paragraph>
            <info>Express is only resposible for routing which works on top of native node moduel http. For anything else is using middleware. And middle is short 
        is just a function(req,res,next) that execute and goes to the next() middlware function until we return res.next() or any other response.</info>
   <example>
        
/ ------- example middleware --------- /

app.use(function(res,req,next)=>{
//do your staff and return next() when U are done!
next();
//next will go to the next middleware function
})

/--- those are the most common middleware for exprsss ---/

app.use(cors())
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }))

explanation:
cors is used for non-block sameorigin http calls
bodyparser alows you to get content of http request by req.body

/------ IMPORATANT even routes are constructed as middleware function ----/

app.get('/legos'),(req,res,next)=>{
//posible response 
rest.send()
res.header('Content-Type', 'application/json; charset=utf-8')
res.render('index');

/-----   but you could also call next() if there is no res.something() already 
/-----   route is the last on the list to visit that is why it needs to responded at that point not next()

}) 


    </example>
        </paragraph>
        <subtitle>types of express Middleware</subtitle>
        <paragraph>
            <info>
              There are several types of express middleware: U can devide them into internal and third-party middleware. The order you execute your middleware
              matters as explained below:
            </info>
            <example>
/ -------- /
application middleware/build-in middleware
/------/

those need to be executed first cause they are resposible for setting our static files
app.use(express.static('views'))

/ -------- /
third-party middleware
/------/

those depends what they do they should be executed before certain action being detected as for bodyParser before receiving routes
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }))

/ ------ /
routes 
/---- / 

U might be suprise why routes are in a middlware section?, well they are part of them when we excute route We want to respond to the browser 
as res.render(index) but we can also handle error by next(error) to be send to our error middleware 

/ ------ /
error middleware (it always needs 4 params to detect from other middleware )
/---- / 

/lets assume we have below route that triggers error

app.get('/legos'),(req,res,next)=>{
  next(new Error('no way!'))
})
  app.use(function(err,res,req,next)=>{
  //handle error
  console.log(error)
  //do your staff and return next() when U are done!
  next();
})

/------/

            </example>
        </paragraph>
        <subtitle>custom middleware</subtitle>
        <paragraph>
            <info>the beauty of middleware is the fact that is just a function! so we can easily make custom ones to serve our purpose in a middlware chain.</info>
            <example>
/ ---- /
  custom middleware request it is with a dot adnotation so node recognize it as custom note a module from node_modules;
/ ----/

car customMiddlware = require('./custom')

/---- quite often our custom middleware is wrapped in higher order functio to pass some params ---/

const custom = (param)=>{
  return fuction(req,res,next){
  //do something 
  next()
  //move on to the next one...
  }
}

/---- execute custom middleware ----/

app.get('/legos', custom(param), function(req,res,)=>{
  res.render('I am cool now!')
})

explanation:
the custom midllware could be execute on route level, so the application gets to route and then executes the stack of middlware
on this level it could take fuctions or array of functions

app.get('/legos', custom(param),custom1(param), function(req,res,)=>{})

stack = [custom(param),custom1(param)];
app.get('/legos', stack, function(req,res,)=>{})

        <subtitle>Delegating work to the Middleware (multiuse abstraction)</subtitle>
        <paragraph>
            <info>Express comes with some helper middleware as app.param that alows you to do some logic outsite the route and then give you the result back in route</info>
            <example>
/--- let say U got route as one below ----/

/----
now every time we hit any route with id as 'legos/:i d' or 'lions/lion/:id' 
express can delegate what we can do with id in a seperate middlware 
 ----\

app.param('id', function(req,res,next){
  //do something with id
  next()
  //move on to next
})

/--- this route has to be after app.param --/
app.use('legos/:id',function(req,res){})

var toDoListRouter = express.Router();
var guesscheckoutRouter = express.Router();

//now regiester them with the main app express;
app.use('/toDoListRouter',loginRouter)
app.use('/guesscheckout',guesscheckoutRouter)

explanation:
app.use('/guesscheckout',guesscheckoutRouter) middleware allows to delegate the work of handling any /guesscheckout/...
routes to the guesscheckoutRouter middleware

/-----/

            </example>
        </paragraph>
        <subtitle>sub-routing</subtitle>
        <paragraph>
            <info>sub-routing allow you to create addtional routes that derived from master route as app.get(/masterPath/)</info>
            <example>

/---- register our route with main app and delegate any /guesscheckout/additionalpath to loginRouter path ---/

app.use('/guesscheckout',guesscheckout)


/ ---- sub-routes to /guesscheckout path -----/

guesscheckout.get('/',function(req,res){
//this routes corresponds to /guesscheckout/ === /guesscheckout
res.render('..ok I will do it')}
)
guesscheckout.get('/:id',function(req,res){
 //this routes corresponds to /guesscheckout/:id 
res.render('..yeah I am a guest !')
})

info:
sub-routing are great for organizing, abstracting away your routes and put them in seperate file and simple export to require them in main server file:
module.exports = guesscheckout

var PostSchema = {
  title:{
    type:String,
    required:true,
    unique:true
  }
  text:{
    type:String,
    required:true
    }
  author:{
    type:Shema.Types.ObjectId
    ref:'user'
  }
  categories:[
    {
    type:Shema.Types.ObjectId
    ref:'category'
  }]
}

/---- the possible post could be: ----/
"posts":{
  "title": "Life of PI"
  "text": "Aparently is a great book and movie!"
  author: "ObjectId(436353453535353e423d)"
  categories:[
      "ObjectId(4r554353453535353e423d)",
      "ObjectId(43336353453535353e423d)"
      "ObjectId(55555353453535353e423d)"
  ]
}

explanation:
Post model has PostSchema that has fields: title, text, author, categories.
Notice that author and categories are diffrent: 
author is referenced in user Model with its ID.
categories are in array referenced in category Model by its IDs. so we dont bring categories name here if we want to access
them We would use their ids and fields set in Category Model. Therefore is so important to use GUI interface for choosing
reference type data to not make it mistake. Dont update them in code unless you know every category unique ID reference.


            </example>
        </paragraph>
        <subtitle>mongoose populate ID</subtitle>
        <paragraph>
            <info>It is possible to save the record without ObjectID in one of the fields and populate that field later in another post Query</info>
            <example>

/ --- / 
check if the field is populated ?

post.populated('author'); // truthy 

/ -- /

What about creating a post ?

/---- the possible post could be: ----/
  "posts":{
    "title": "Life of PI"
    "text": "Aparently is a great book and movie!"
    //author: NOT ADDED
    categories:[
        "ObjectId(4r554353453535353e423d)",
        "ObjectId(43336353453535353e423d)"
        "ObjectId(55555353453535353e423d)"
    ]
  }

explanation:
just because athour is not required and not unique field we can save our post without it. But that means we just created a post
who doesnt have an author. There are at least 2 wasy to fix that. 

1. use populate method as

  Post.
    findOne({ title: 'Casino Royale' })
    .populate('author')
    .exec(function (err, story) {
      if (err) return handleError(err);
      console.log('The author is %s', story.author.name);
      // prints "The author is Ian Fleming"
    });
This will look for Post title and populate with the ID of the only Author in collection. ONLY one is fine but what if there is more authors?
well then will go crazy. The moongoose documentation says this: 'If you have an array of authors in your storySchema, populate() will give you an empty array instead.' so unless U have only one author then will work otherwise dont use populate!

2. Another way of filling the author fiels is to grab current author ID and pass it in POST Query as merge object {author:ObjectID(83t34t),...rest} that way
we fill it right when post in created with the author that is logged in.
