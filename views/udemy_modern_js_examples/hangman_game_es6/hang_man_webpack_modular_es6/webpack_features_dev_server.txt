			1) install webpack-dev-server@3.1.1 version it will refresh content after changing automatically
			2 also you should specify which mode you want to run your sever production or development add this script to package.json

				"webpack-dev-server": "webpack-dev-server --mode development",
				"build": "webpack --mode production"
