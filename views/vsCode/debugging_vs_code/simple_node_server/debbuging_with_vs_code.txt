	Vs code allows you to run debuggeing process by :
		1) attach request so U will attach debugger to already running server instance 
		2) or launch so U will launch a server from the editor 

	to make your debugger setting persistent you need to create launch.js file which will be automatically created for you 
	once you open debugger mode and follow all the prompts.

	Vs code will pick server enviroment for you but in case it will not determine it you can pick from :

	node, python,.net... and  chrome (front-end suppport explained in seperate article in this directory)

	There are several types of attach or launch debugging which will come up one you edit this file.
	For example for attach you can pick 'attach to process' and then vs_code allows you which application of node you want to debug on.

	Also you can enable some extension for more pleasant debugging: (to be continue)
