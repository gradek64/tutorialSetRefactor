1 create .eslintrc with bare content 

	{
 	 "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "prettier"]
}	

then install package 
	npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier

it allows you to marry them together, U shoud try do that for global setting so you dont need to set .eslint evey time and istall that package 

But the best sollution is to sort it out globally so with those packages react eslint seems to be happy for minimum requirements nothing fancy
