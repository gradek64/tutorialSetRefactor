		
		1) check if that works for your the hard-coded link for sublime 			executatbale file 

		open /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl

		2) if it works we need to link that to our $PATH global with a simlink as below:

			ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/sublime

		 above we have: ln- s (soft link) (main_source ) (link to be shown to execute)

		3) open or create .bash_profile in your home directory with this content 
			
			# export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin (or and) /usr/local/bin
			export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
		any execution fo terminal command will look what is yoru $PATH setup and will look for sublime command

		4) test your work by 

			sublime ./ or (file_name) etc ..
