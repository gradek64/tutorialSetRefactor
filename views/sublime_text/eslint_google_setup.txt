		1a) install Sublime eslint SublimeLinter-eslint (https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint#plugin-installation)
			by installing node package first globally:

				npm install -g jshint
		2) install Sublime-contrib-eslint in package control
		
			INSTALL BABEL 

		1) Ensure that you have substituted the correct version lock for eslint and babel-eslint into this command 
				(those have to be setup in your root project so INSTALLED LOCALLY)

			npm install eslint@3.x babel-eslint@7 --save-dev
		
		2) create .eslintrc file for configuration

				{
  					"extends": "google",
  					"parser": "babel-eslint",	
  					"rules": {
    						// Additional, per-project rules.	..
  					  "require-jsdoc": 0
  				} 
		3) go to Sublime -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> SublimeLinter -> Settings and make sure you have this:
	
			"syntax_map": {
 				 "JavaScript (Babel)": "javascript",
			}	
		
		4) install Babel through Package Control
		4) you need to setup all .js files set up to (babel) javascript by :
					
				Syntax -> apply to all - javascript (babel);
		5) set up linting for Sublime-contrib-eslint plugin settings as background (it seems to only work on background setting not onSAVE)
